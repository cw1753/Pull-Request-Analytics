the `console.log` in the Ramda Repl displays `undefined` as `null` in arrays, and doesn't display object properties that have a value of `undefined`. The global properties `NaN` and `Infinity` are also displayed as `null` in arrays and objects. \r\n\r\nThis has caught me out a few times - so I thought I'd have a go at putting in a fix! Will close #49\r\n\r\n**Example of problem from the Repl**\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(\r\n  [null, undefined, NaN, Infinity, -Infinity], \r\n  { a: null, b:undefined, c:NaN, d:Infinity, e:-Infinity}\r\n)  \r\n[null,null,null,null,null]\r\n{\"a\":null,\"c\":null,\"d\":null,\"e\":null}\r\n```\r\nI added a `replacer` function to the `JSON.stringify` method of `logger.js` - which covers common properties that `JSON.stringify` doesn't support.

comment code (line/block) within the REPL. \r\n\r\nI imported the comment addon from CodeMirror along with the Sublime keymap that will enable commenting of code with `CMD/CTRL + /`.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to get the functionality to work, however. I used the [graphql/graphiql REPL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/blob/master/src/components/QueryEditor.js) as a guide as it uses CodeMirror in a similar style and has the commenting functionality.\r\n\r\nMy only guess after hitting a wall with it is that what the Ramda is doing to process the input is ignoring/blocking the commenting functionality.\r\n\r\nI hope someone is able to chip in and help get this feature added.

is intended to address some issues we have when REPL loads scripts.\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n\r\n- The REPL will always instantiate given that `ramdaScript` loads.\r\n- A red indicator will be displayed in the top right corner if `ramdaScript` fails to load.

this PR\n- A minify command (`npm run minify`) is added to reduce JavaScript size. This is presently using the default settings of [uglify-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js). `bundle.js` is reduced from ~2.9M to ~1.6M. (Pre gzip figures) `bundle.css` is already minified in its normal build step. Closes #30?\n- The `npm run` commands have been modified to provide additional features:\n  - `npm run build-js` will build JS (unminified) with sourcemaps provided thanks to [exorcist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/exorcist) :scream:\n  - `npm run watch-js` - as per `build-js` while watching JS files for changes.\n  - `npm run build-css` will build CSS.\n  - `npm run watch-css` - as per `build-css` but watching for CSS file changes.\n  - `npm run watch` combines both `watch-*` commands.\n- [README.md](README.md) has been updated to reflect these

is an attempt at adding a bit more feedback / control over script loading. It's a bit cursory, I hope it might lead to things like enabling dynamically loaded external resources (dropdown with ramda versions, perhaps?). For now it might help with handling errors when loading external scripts.\n\nAt present this will enable us to define (with a bit of JSON) which scripts we would like to load and how they will be exposed on the `window` object. Upon instantiation, _repl_ will load the scripts - first `ramda`, then - given that succeeds - the rest of the scripts in parallel.\n\nWhile they load a spinner is presented, and upon a successful load the repl controls become enabled. If a script _fails_ to load the repl will not start, and a very basic error message is displayed. One way to test this is to give an incorrect `src` within the config.\n\nOf note: The repl will have `ramda` and `ramda-fantasy` baked in as part of its implementation. This is intended to trade a bit of extra downloading for the ability to load any version of ramda (and friends) without needing to be concerned how API movement might impact the repl code.\n###

PR addresses two project goals - configuration and embedding.\n### Embedding\n\nWe now expose a global function called `ramdaRepl` which takes two arguments - a reference to a target DOM node (such as a `<code>` block in the docs that we want to replace with a repl) - and a configuration object.\n\nOn application, the target DOM node is hidden and `ramdaRepl` will construct the DOM for the REPL and inject it as a sibling.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I've removed the repl HTML from `index.html` and replaced it with a target `<code>` element, similar to what we have on the Ramda doc pages. Clicking it will replace it with a repl instance.\n\nThe DOM structure for the repl is now declared as a JSON-like tree in `lib/js/dom/structure.js` and is converted into DOM nodes by `lib/js/dom/constructDOM.js`. Once this is complete it is put in the document and has the event handlers hooked up.\n### Configuration\n\nAs per #9, the code relating to reading / updating the document fragment has been taken out and can be re-implemented using the `config` object (the second argument to `ramdaRepl`) - see example.\n\nAdditionally, the URLs for the API key and the return address are also passed in using the same object. Given either of these urls is not present, the shortlink control will not be shown.\n### Example config\n\n```\nramdaRepl(targetNode, {\n\n  apiUrl: 'https://www.googleapis.com/urlshortener/v1/url?key=AIzaSyDhbAvT5JqkxFPkoeezJp19-S_mAJudxyk',\n  returnUrl: 'http://ramdajs.com/repl/',\n\n  // If unset, initialValue will use the value or textcontent of the\n  // target element.\n  initialValue: URI.decode(window.location.hash).substring(2),\n\n  // Called with the pre-compiled content whenever it is changed.\n  onChange : function(code) {\n    // Here we can update the address\n    window.location.hash = '?' + URI.encode(code);\n  }\n\n});\n```\n### Demo\n\nhttps://craigdallimore.github.io/repl/\n","created_at":"2016-09-25T11:22:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T17:54:56Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T00:15:27Z","merged_at":"2016-09-29T00:15:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1205f32ee508879261ef44822745c0e23416ebe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/repl/pulls/13/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/repl/pulls/13/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/repl/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/repl/issues/13/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/repl/statuses/1ee1a246cc540a395d02b2f708f34de0b605a1d4","head":{"label":"craigdallimore:configuration","ref":"configuration","sha":"1ee1a246cc540a395d02b2f708f34de0b605a1d4","user":{"login":"craigdallimore","id":926283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNjI4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/926283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore","html_url":"https://github.com/craigdallimore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68179211,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODE3OTIxMQ==","name":"repl","full_name":"craigdallimore/repl","private":false,"owner":{"login":"craigdallimore","id":926283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNjI4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/926283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore","html_url":"https://github.com/craigdallimore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craigdallimore/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/craigdallimore/repl","description":"The

to: #7 \n\nHello\n\nHere is a start for some tests - using [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) and [fake-xml-http-request](https://github.com/pretenderjs/FakeXMLHttpRequest) - the latter of which I found more effective than the `sinon` fake XHR / fake server utilities for simulating the shortlink request. Alas even so I had to change `response` to `responseText` in `googl.js` as the library did not simulate that property.\n\nI've made a few changes - hopefully not too heavy handed - in order to make testing a little easier: \n- DOM elements are passed to the various bind-listener-to-element files rather than being looked up in those files. Doing so gives us one place (presently `repl.js`) where we can go to to see which selectors are being used to bind to the DOM, and protects the tests from needing to know the specifics of the DOM.\n- A reference to the `console` object is being passed to the `logger` (AKA `reporter`); thus we can spy on wrapped console methods without interfering with the console that the test reporter uses to provide feedback.\n- The \"clear\" and \"reset\" button behaviours now have their own files so each could be imported and tested individually.\n\nI haven't got to testing the actual code input / output panes themselves. This is already a big collection of changes so I figured it appropriate to share before going

this PR\n- The `npm run build` task (which was apparently in need of babel configuration) is fixed by adding a `.babelrc` file.\n- Added the `npm run dev` and `npm run server` tasks.

this PR are the following changes:\n- `eslint` and `editorconfig` configuration (adapted for some of the globals)\n- `gitignore` and `eslintignore` files (hiding `/node_modules` and `bundle.js` respectively)\n- Adjustments to whitespace, quotes, unused varaibles as per the ramda `eslint` config\n- Suppression of the `eval` warning\n- an `npm run lint` command that will lint the files in `./lib`.\n\nI wasn't sure what to do about the files in `/example` so they are not linted at present. #1 \n\nTotally happy to drop this or make adjustments if this is
