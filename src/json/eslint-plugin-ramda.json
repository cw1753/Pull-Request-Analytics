pull-request implements support for specialized calls via `R`. Soon, a good improvement will be making the a parameter, but it solves the problem for now. I suggest using `2.1.0` as version name for this.\r\n\r\nNow, both `R.map(R.prop)` and `map(prop)` can be recognized and works mutually. Adapting to check the scope later also became easier; I've added an `ast-helper` to get the work done. We currently have `135` tests.\r\n\r\nThis introduces no breaking changes.\r\nThis introduces no new rules.\r\n\r\nCloses #7.\r\nThanks @polytypic for reporting and @lo1tuma for the
