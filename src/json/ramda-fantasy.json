commit comes from my need to use Maybe only as I do not need the rest. Thus,\nI do `require('ramda-fantasy/src/Maybe')`. But the problem with the old way of doing require in `ramda-fantasy` is that tree shaking can not be performed.\nAlthough only three functions are used in this module from `ramda`, the whole library (`ramda`) is included in my build through `ramda-fantasy`.\n\nI use rollup in order to build my code as it can perform tree shaking. Thus, the features that are not required in my code are not included in build. However, dependencies\nalso need to include the only parts they need.\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T14:07:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-20T19:08:25Z","closed_at":"2016-08-19T23:17:06Z","merged_at":"2016-08-19T23:17:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"a48e9b90ea3a2daf6efa1b40dad52c78156c9a93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pulls/119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pulls/119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/issues/119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/statuses/b85d0d32226a6f73f39b0a55576518fe651ba1ae","head":{"label":"raqystyle:fix/include-only-what-is-needed","ref":"fix/include-only-what-is-needed","sha":"b85d0d32226a6f73f39b0a55576518fe651ba1ae","user":{"login":"raqystyle","id":1846484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDY0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1846484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle","html_url":"https://github.com/raqystyle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66063031,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA2MzAzMQ==","name":"ramda-fantasy","full_name":"raqystyle/ramda-fantasy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"raqystyle","id":1846484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDY0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1846484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle","html_url":"https://github.com/raqystyle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raqystyle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/raqystyle/ramda-fantasy","description":":ram::sparkles:

a failing unit test for discussion**\n\nHello again,\n\nI've been working a tremendous amount with Futures of late. I've always liked Promises since their earliest introduction. Futures to me are the next step. They have a predictable API which is very easy to abstract over and therefore they integrate very well with stuff like Ramda.\n\nHowever, despite being able to express all manner of async behaviour using just `chain` for sequences and `ap` for parrallelism, I find myself really missing a native, chainable way to do races. This is where `concat` comes in, which was heavily inspired by [its implementation in `data.task`](https://github.com/folktale/data.task/blob/master/lib/task.js#L137-L175).\n\nSorella commented it to be a Semigroup, as is also indicated by my passing _is a Semigroup_ -test. Yet I've never really trusted it to always behave this way under race conditions, so I decided to write another test: _associativity is not broken by race-conditions_, which turned out to fail.\n\nAfter some days of this branch collecting dust, I still decided to make a PR just to share my findings and maybe someone might yet point out that I'm wrong somehow and Sorella was right about her assessment of this implementation being a proper Semigroup. That's what I'm secretly hoping for, because it'd be really nice to get Semigroup and async races in Futures.\n\nIf, however, we collectively reach the conclusion that Future being Semigroup is in fact impossible, I'll gladly back down and implement this function as a helper in my code base

many internal `fork` calls to `_fork` calls to reduce needless try-catch wrapping of internal functions that were never going to throw. Taken from [pull 79](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pull/79) where it was originally introduced.\n\nThe reason behind this change is that _try-catch-wrapping_ [might cost some performance](https://jsperf.com/try-catch/7). I haven't actually tested this for performance gains, but I'd imagine that all that try-catch wrapping when using Future-heavy code might add

noticed Ramda Future wraps `fork` in a _try-catch_. I'm assuming this was done with the intention to automatically catch errors from throwing user functions. In a purely functional world that wouldn't make sense, but I can appreciate the idea that this protects users of Future from the rigors of multi-paradigm.\n\nHowever, I think that Futures should either _have_ this behaviour (like `bluebird`), or not have it at all (like `data.task`), but Ramda Futures have it \"_sometimes_\", as demonstrated by the following code (also added as unit test), and I think this is quite confusing:\n\n``` js\n//The error is caught and handled by handler:\nFuture.of(1).map(throws).fork(handler, noop);\n\n//The error escapes and destroys everything you ever loved:\ndelayedFutureOf(1).map(throws).fork(handler, noop);\n```\n\n> Open debugger to see effects: http://goo.gl/crHJ5F\n\nAnother issue with the current implementation is that often, functions that we know are _pure_ are also being wrapped in try-catch statements. This [probably](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pull/82) results in unnecessary performance loss.\n\nI tried to solve both issues with the following changes:\n- ~~Switched many internal \"fork\" calls to \"_fork\" calls to reduce needless try-catch wrapping of internal functions that were never going to throw.~~ (see [pull 82](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pull/82))\n- Wrapped potentially throwing user functions in try-catch to ensure the error will end up in the rejection branch.\n\nAnother solution would be to never try-catch, which could be implemented by simply removing `Future#fork` and assigning it in the constructor.\n\n> #### Disclaimer\n> \n> I haven't actually tested for performance gains or losses.

changes adds support for creating sum and product ADTs. I'm not entirely sure this belongs in ramda-fantasy or not, but it does make declaring data types clean and consistent (at least in my opinion).\n\nI've also got a separate branch with the existing types converted to using ADTs for those who are curious: https://github.com/scott-christopher/ramda-fantasy/blob/adt/src/Maybe.js (I wanted to keep this PR focussed on the ADT implementation itself, before discussing changing anything else).\n\nI've added the comments from the code below that describes the general usage.\n\n---\n## Product types\n\nProduct types can be created by calling `product` with strings representing the fields to exist on each type.\n\nFor example, the following will create a `Point` type with two fields (`x` and `y`):\n\n``` js\nvar Point = Type.product('x', 'y');\n```\n\nInstances are created by calling the type as a function:\n\n``` js\nvar origin = Point(0, 0);\norigin instanceof Point // true\n```\n\nOnce an instance is created, its fields can be accessed via getter methods attached to the instance:\n\n``` js\nvar originX = origin.x();\n```\n\nAlternatively an instance can be unapplied, providing access to all its fields in one call:\n\n``` js\norigin.unapply(function(x, y) {\n  return x === 0 && y === 0;\n});\n```\n\nValues of a product instance can also be modified, however because the instances are immutable this will cause a new instance to be returned with the modified value rather than mutating the previous instance.\n\n``` js\nvar x1y0 = origin.x(1);\nx1y0.x(); // 1\n\n// note `origin` remains unmodified\norigin.x(); // 0\n```\n\nWhen a type is created, lenses for each field are also available on the type constructor:\n\n``` js\nR.view(Point.x, point); // 0\nR.set(Point.y, point);  // Point(0, 1);\n```\n## Sum Types\n\nSum types can be created by calling `sum` with an object that describes its constructors.\n\nFor example will create a `List` type, with two constructors `Cons` and `Nil`:\n\n``` js\nvar List = Type.sum({ Cons: ['head', 'tail'], Nil: [] });\nvar Cons = List.Cons;\nvar Nil = List.Nil;\n```\n\nThe constructors behave exactly the same as product type constructors:\n\n``` js\nvar abc = Cons('a', Cons('b', Cons('c', Nil)));\nabc instanceof Cons; // true\nabc instanceof List; // true\n\nvar c = abc.tail().tail().head();\n// or\nvar c = R.view(R.compose(Cons.tail, Cons.tail, Cons.head), abc);\n\nabc.unapply(function(head, tail) {\n  return head + head + head;\n}); // \"aaa\"\n```\n\nIf a constructor is declared with no fields, a singleton instance of that constructor is returned instead:\n\n``` js\nNil instanceof List; // true\nNil.unapply(function() { return '?'; }); // '?'\n```\n\nAn instance can also be matched and dispatched against its type:\n\n``` js\nfunction headOrElse(other, list) {\n  return list.match({\n    Cons: function(head, tail) { return head; },\n    Nil: function() { return other; }\n

don't quite know where this sits on a scale from zero to absurd, but it's effectively a newtype wrapper for functions, providing implementations for a number of the fantasy land specs without polluting the global `Function.prototype`.\n\nThe result of calling `Fn` is a curried function, with a bunch of methods attached:\n\n``` js\nvar add = Fn((a, b) => a + b);\nvar mul = Fn((a, b) => a * b);\n\nadd(1, 2); // 3\nvar incr = add(1);\nincr(2); // 3\n\nadd(2).compose(mul(4))(10); // 42\nadd(2).map(mul(4))(10); // 48\n\nFn(R.prepend).ap(R.of)('x'); // [ 'x', 'x' ]\n\nmul(2).chain(a =>\n  add(10).chain(b =>\n    Fn.of(a + b)))(3) // 19\n```\n\nIt also adds some pretty printing, which _should_ survive currying and also include any partially applied arguments:\n\n``` js\nvar add = function Fn(add(a, b) { return a + b; });\nadd.toString(); // Fn[add](_, _)\nadd(1).toString(); // Fn[add](1, _)\n\nvar anonId = Fn(x => x);\nFn(anonId).toString(); // Fn(_)\n```\n\nIf anyone is familiar with the various class implementations for function types, please provide some feedback as this was a bit of a learning exercise for me. In particular, some confirmation that the laws are in fact tested correctly would be most welcome. Unfortunately the existing law assertions in `tests/types.js` couldn't be used because they require the type to implement `equals`, which can't easily be defined for functions. I do however have another change I can submit for allowing a custom equality function to be passed in to the type assertions, which would resolve this.\n","created_at":"2015-06-25T13:15:53Z","updated_at":"2015-08-12T09:14:01Z","closed_at":"2015-08-12T09:14:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01896b2ace7ac61bbb6cec8929bb7c24c9a507c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pulls/57/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pulls/57/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/issues/57/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda-fantasy/statuses/60286e616588755ee7df2c9f2e027ceadfd700bb","head":{"label":"scott-christopher:fn","ref":"fn","sha":"60286e616588755ee7df2c9f2e027ceadfd700bb","user":{"login":"scott-christopher","id":8951601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTE2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8951601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher","html_url":"https://github.com/scott-christopher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":37435352,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzQzNTM1Mg==","name":"ramda-fantasy","full_name":"scott-christopher/ramda-fantasy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scott-christopher","id":8951601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTE2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8951601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher","html_url":"https://github.com/scott-christopher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-christopher/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scott-christopher/ramda-fantasy","description":":ram::sparkles:

sure if there is interest in going down the transformer path or not, but I ended up with this after wanting a Reader/Future combo.\n\nAn example:\n\n``` js\nvar Reader = require('./src/Reader'),\n    Future = require('./src/Future'),\n    ReaderTFuture = Reader.T(Future);\n\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n\nvar delay = d => Future((_, done) => setTimeout(done, d));\n\nvar delayedText =

merge this yet.\n\nSo, the tests pass before and after this change, but this is a fairly huge change as far as semantics go. Before, it wasn't a `Functor`, `Apply`, `Chain`, or `Monad` (as all of the functions depended on `chain` working properly), now it \"should\" be. I say \"should\" because I'm not actually sure this fix actually fixed it. This tells me that the tests aren't actually testing the semantics here, so we should discuss what should change such that the tests work properly.\n\nI have not looked at the tests yet to see where the failure is.
