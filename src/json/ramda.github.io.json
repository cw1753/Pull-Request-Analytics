tonicdev in an HTML page and started putting in examples from the Cookbook.\n\nAdded another top level nav item.\n\nThere are some examples, even in this prototype, that don't work as is.  For example, **Mess with the DOM** needs a `document`, and **Derivative of R.props for deep fields** returns an error `Cannot read property 'call' of undefined`.\n\nI wanted to get the PR up so the team can decide if they like having a top level menu item as well as using tonicdev, before I put more time in to implementing the remaining examples.\n\n<img width=\"1418\" alt=\"screen shot
