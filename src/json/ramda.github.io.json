Starts with Make\r\n2. Then finish off with a couple of disconnected NPM run scripts\r\n3. The index file for the REPL seemed to have gone AWOL\r\n\r\nSince we have `Make` already I consolidated everything with just a few Make targets. The REPL now shows the correct version and has the Gitter integration working.\r\n\r\nI couldn't see why keeping the docs for all versions was necessary. Unless I am mistaken there is no way to access the docs for previous versions? I deleted lots of scripts and workflows related to keeping all the docs for all the versions. I didn't go as far as removing the docs themselves.\r\n\r\nA couple of handlebars templates didn't seem to be in use anymore so I deleted them.\r\n\r\nI also deleted lots of scripts and resources related to maintaining an index of releases. This seems to have been abandoned since 0.22.0 I think.\r\n\r\nI took the liberty to disable the GitBook integration as it was failing the original build system anyway.

href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md#v460---january-8th-2020\">4.6.0</a> now also apply\nin when using the compile-option &quot;strict: true&quot;. Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods\ncan be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1633\">#1633</a> for details. If you are using Handlebars as documented, you should not be accessing prototype properties\nfrom your template anyway, so the changes should not be a problem for you.

That said, we're very conservative about what we consider a breaking change.</p>\n<p><em>i.e., if there it could possibly break things for anyone, it's typically a breaking change.</em>  The fact is a vast majority of users should upgrade and probably not notice any changes at all.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/VERSION_10_BREAKING_CHANGES.md\">VERSION_10_BREAKING_CHANGES.md</a> for a comprehensive list of breaking changes, but here is a summary... if you use:</p>\n<h3>Core highlight.js lib on the client (with no extra CDN languages)</h3>\n<p>Just keep doing that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're using <code>darkula.css</code>, you'll need to change that to <code>darcula.css</code></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

2019</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: add &quot;no-prototype-builtins&quot; eslint-rule and fix all occurences - f7f05d7</li>\n<li>fix: add more properties required to be enumerable - 1988878</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chores / Build:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0 - c02b05f</li>\n<li>add chai and dirty-chai and sinon, for cleaner test-assertions and spies,\ndeprecate old assertion-methods - 93e284e, 886ba86, 0817dad, 93516a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Security:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The properties <code>__proto__</code>, <code>__defineGetter__</code>, <code>__defineSetter__</code> and <code>__lookupGetter__</code>\nhave been added to the list of &quot;properties that must be enumerable&quot;.\nIf a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent,\nit will silently evaluate to <code>undefined</code>. This is done in both the compiled template and the &quot;lookup&quot;-helper.\nThis will prevent new Remote-Code-Execution exploits that have been\npublished recently.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compatibility notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to the security-fixes. The semantics of the templates using\n<code>__proto__</code>, <code>__defineGetter__</code>, <code>__defineSetter__</code> and <code>__lookupGetter__</code> in the respect that those expression now return\n<code>undefined</code> rather than their actual value from the proto.</li>\n<li>The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable, as in:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>{\n  __proto__: 'some string';\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The change may be breaking in that respect, but we still only\nincrease the patch-version, because the incompatible use-cases\nare not intended, undocumented and far less important than fixing\nRemote-Code-Execution exploits on existing systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.5.2...v4.5.3\">Commits</a></p>\n<h2>v4.5.2 - November 13th, 2019</h2>\n<h1>Bugfixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: use String(field) in lookup when checking for &quot;constructor&quot; - d541378</li>\n<li>test: add fluent API for testing Handlebars - c2ac79c</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compatibility notes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/c819c8b533934d2ac18001d7eb27a3205b00c2f3\"><code>c819c8b</code></a> v4.5.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/827c9d0747bef7d7f89829779523b6b2dcf3051d\"><code>827c9d0</code></a> Update release notes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/f7f05d7558e674856686b62a00cde5758f3b7a08\"><code>f7f05d7</code></a> fix: add &quot;no-prototype-builtins&quot; eslint-rule and fix all occurences</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/198887808780bbef9dba67a8af68ece091d5baa7\"><code>1988878</code></a> fix: add more properties required to be enumerable</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/886ba86c2f9cc71b7d99b9018fbe2d72a57085cc\"><code>886ba86</code></a> test/chore: add chai/expect and sinon to &quot;runtime&quot;-environment</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/0817dad7e72c51d07f7700547d0c69aa79a4976b\"><code>0817dad</code></a> test: add sinon as global variable to eslint in the specs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/93516a0b07026ebd23c84fddf270a0c8b570bc59\"><code>93516a0</code></a> test: add sinon.js for spies, deprecate current assertions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/93e284ed9be1e38c5e6945f15af1ccd689f2ada6\"><code>93e284e</code></a> chore: add chai and dirty-chai for better test assertions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/c02b05fa819f46bb66c878bebc6e8006408ebd5c\"><code>c02b05f</code></a> fix: use !== 0 instead of != 0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/commit/8de121d21c88a6ab877e3a0eec9daaac483f3bf0\"><code>8de121d</code></a> v4.5.2</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.3.0...v4.5.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=handlebars&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=4.3.0&new-version=4.5.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-github-dependabot-security-updates)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

changelog](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md).*\n\n> ## v4.3.0 - September 24th, 2019\n> Fixes:\n> \n> - Security: Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n> - Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n> \n> Features:\n> \n> - Add new runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to allow calling `blockHelperMissing` and `helperMissing`.\n> \n> Breaking changes:\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - Compiler revision increased - 06b7224\n>   - This means that template compiled with versions prior to 4.3.0 will not work with runtimes >= 4.3.0\n>     The increase was done because the \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" are now moved from the helpers\n>     to the internal \"container.hooks\" object, so old templates will not be able to call them anymore. We suggest\n>     that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines.\n> \n> - Disallow calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly - 2078c72\n>   - Calling \"helperMissing\" and \"blockHelperMissing\" directly from a template (like in `{{blockHelperMissing}}` was \n>     never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in 2019 \n>     (see https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). *It is also part of a new exploit that \n>     is not captured by the earlier fix.* In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits, calling thos helpers \n>     is now not possible anymore. *Overriding* those helpers is still possible.\n>   - If you really need this behavior, you can set the runtime option `allowCallsToHelperMissing` to `true` and the\n>     calls will again be possible\n> \n> Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not 100% percent compatible to 4.2.0, despite the minor version bump.\n> \n> We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain 100% compatibility.\n> \n>     \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.1...v4.3.0)\n> \n> ## v4.2.1 - September 20th, 2019\n> Bugfixes: \n> \n> - The \"browser\" property in the package.json has been updated to use the common-js builds instead of the minified UMD - c55a7be, [#1553](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1553)\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - No compatibility issues should arise\n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1)\n> \n> ## v4.2.0 - September 3rd, 2019\n> Chore/Test:\n> - Use custom `grunt-saucelab` with current sauce-connect proxy - f119497\n> - Add framework for various integration tests - f9cce4d\n></tr></table> ...

[#1515](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/pull/1515) - Port over linting and test for typings ([@&#8203;zimmi88](https://api.github.com/users/zimmi88))\n> - chore: add

Compatibility notes:\n> \n> Access to the constructor of a class thought `{{lookup obj \"constructor\" }}` is now prohibited. This closes \n> a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.\n> \n> This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described\n> in [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495). We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, \n> and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version\n> and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)\n> \n> ## v4.1.1 - March 16th, 2019\n> Bugfixes:\n> - fix: add \"runtime.d.ts\" to allow \"require('handlebars/runtime')\" in TypeScript - 5cedd62\n> \n> Refactorings:\n> - replace \"async\" with \"neo-async\" - 048f2ce\n> - use \"substring\"-function instead of \"substr\" - 445ae12\n> \n> Compatibility notes:\n> - This is a bugfix release. There are no breaking change and no new features.\n> \n> \n> [Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1)\n> \n> ## v4.1.0 - February 7th, 2019\n> New Features\n> \n> - import TypeScript typings - 27ac1ee\n> \n> Security fixes:\n> \n> - disallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, [#1495](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1495)\n> \n> Housekeeping\n> \n> - chore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473\n> - chore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c\n> - chore/doc: Add more release docs - 6b87c21\n> \n></tr></table> ...

discussed in https://github.com/ramda/ramda.github.io/pull/190#issuecomment-331838683, the PUG based template has some minor styling issue on the repl. This is due to the over-general css class `.repl` introduced in https://github.com/ramda/ramda.github.io/pull/185/files#diff-e73ad0a6a3cca0e9ce1279bf47761a0eR45. That PR itself is fine because `repl/index.html` did not include `style.css`. But when the PR https://github.com/ramda/ramda.github.io/pull/175/files#diff-8ca7384ffd04b23fb9f8dde4473e055fR14 refactored the repl index.pug template to inherit the same `layout.pug` which includes `style.css`, the interference of the css style takes effect.\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://monosnap.com/file/VPHdlLk41aN373gAh8mfidv56awPYS.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR made the css class name and selector for docs more selective to avoid messing up with the `.repl` class in the repl.\r\n\r\nI re-generated `style.css`, but not sure if I should update the one in `0.24.1` folder or anywhere else.\r\n\r\n@MattMS @tolmasky @buzzdecafe

Sorry that I could not figure out how to use the new pug based template introduced in https://github.com/ramda/ramda.github.io/pull/175. It also looks like the current repl/index.html has been manually modified in the past few commits. Feel free to update the pug template to support the same, if this PR is accepted.  @MattMS \r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n * [ ] merge https://github.com/ramda/repl/pull/51 and upload 1.1.0 of

like to propose using RunKit embeds for the examples in Ramda's documentation. The main benefits over the current system are:\r\n\r\n1. The examples are runnable inline, allowing users to stay on the main documentation page and see the documentation, etc.\r\n2. Since it uses RunKit, when users edit the samples, they can make use of other packages as well.\r\n3. Users can select different versions of node to see possible differences in behavior.\r\n4. The results are presented with our nice object viewers, in particular, stack trace viewer which is particularly helpful for beginners ( http://blog.runkit.com/2017/02/01/stop-filing-bugs-file-a-container.html ).\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-04 at 10 15 32 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23753/27838808-c26ed11c-60a1-11e7-9bcb-e7d5043b0e68.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI've modeled this commit after Lodash's use of RunKit for their own documentation (https://lodash.com/docs/). Namely, the embed is only loaded once \"Try it in REPL\" is clicked, and if for whatever reason RunKit is down, it falls back to the current behavior, so the page will never be \"broken\". Lodash has been using RunKit for a year now and they are quite happy with it, and express recently added RunKit for their Getting Started example as well.

Color output for \"Try Ramda\"\n\nIn this PR:\n- `CodeMirror` is reused on the output of the \"Try Ramda\" repl in `readonly` mode, providing consistent syntax highlighting.\n- The _Pretty Button_ and _Reset Button_ now receive a reference to the output CodeMirror object so they can call upon it's API rather than directly manipulating the DOM.\n- The input and output CodeMirror instances derive their config from a common configuration

it was trying to get querystring from the complete URL, so for path like `/path?param=1#?hashParam=2` it would return only the normal query params part `param=1#`, but `code` param was being matched in a hash, so it was getting `code` param from querystring, resulting in `undefined`.\nInstead it should try to extract code param only from hash part (where it's originally passed).\n\nFixes #102 \n\n---\n\nAre there any links to repl site in `/repl?code=foo` format (i.e. using real query params and not hash)?

tonicdev in an HTML page and started putting in examples from the Cookbook.\n\nAdded another top level nav item.\n\nThere are some examples, even in this prototype, that don't work as is.  For example, **Mess with the DOM** needs a `document`, and **Derivative of R.props for deep fields** returns an error `Cannot read property 'call' of undefined`.\n\nI wanted to get the PR up so the team can decide if they like having a top level menu item as well as using tonicdev, before I put more time in to implementing the remaining examples.\n\n<img width=\"1418\" alt=\"screen shot

PR contains my proposal for issue https://github.com/ramda/ramda.github.io/issues/24\n\nThis was my proof of concept, with the inner workings for the css-only hamburger behaviour:\nhttp://codepen.io/branneman/pen/BNvNQB/left/?editors=110\nThis was of course only a quick fix for the sidebar, my final solution has an optimised header & menu as well.\n\nAnd I made a short demo video of how it works and feels on a small screen:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A60DCGq2yCo\n\n@buzzdecafe: Unfortunately I ended up with a hamburger icon, because of the small amount of space available. I would've preferred something different as well, but I didn't get it to look nice. The good news is that it's fairly easy to change in `header.less`, if you can think up something better in the future.\n\nAs an aside, I ran into some problems while trying to build the docs. The grunt task works, but the `npm run docs` fails when there's already a 0.17 directory which is not empty. As a temporary solution I've ran the build with `rm -rf 0.17 && npm run docs`. This works, but it's probably not how you guys are doing it. I am doing it the right way? It is wise to document this somewhere?\n","created_at":"2015-08-03T15:37:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-15T10:41:15Z","closed_at":"2015-08-07T18:02:56Z","merged_at":"2015-08-07T18:02:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"2fe4982b6112fa98253c53d8770920fd303531b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda.github.io/pulls/25/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda.github.io/pulls/25/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda.github.io/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda.github.io/issues/25/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramda/ramda.github.io/statuses/b985e303a22475a7e4eed73868e609c751723860","head":{"label":"branneman:master","ref":"master","sha":"b985e303a22475a7e4eed73868e609c751723860","user":{"login":"branneman","id":172579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjU3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman","html_url":"https://github.com/branneman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40074683,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDA3NDY4Mw==","name":"ramda.github.io","full_name":"branneman/ramda.github.io","private":false,"owner":{"login":"branneman","id":172579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjU3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman","html_url":"https://github.com/branneman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/branneman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/branneman/ramda.github.io","description":"Documentation
